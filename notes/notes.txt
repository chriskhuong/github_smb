CHECKS FOR FRIENDLY FIRE
1.scr_attackState
2.obj_damage


THINGS TO UNCOMMENT
1.obj_player's animation end

* - search for an alternative to physics_apply_impulse function so we don't have to use physics

FOR PLAYER LOBBY USE A LIST INSTEAD OF AN ARRAY for easy object removal and Array Re-ordering

* - Fix collisions

* - Update player input

* - Set up some sort of color select interface for the characters

have color select also change the target color

* - get rid of the actual arm objects and incorporate them into the actual player, same with the target

* - pistols not properly shooting from their gun offset, other guns are

*- go back into obj_lifeFormParent and re-add collision with obj_solidParent (took this out for the sake of PAX)
//DEPTH SYSTEM, which we already have implemented

//ADVANCED BOSS TUTORIAL stopped at the fireball section, not the biggest fan of this tutorial though
//this tutorial is seriously garbage, bad syntax
